**Note**: This petition is related a previous [open letter](https://jasonjwilliamsny.github.io/grfp2025/](https://jasonjwilliamsny.github.io/grfp2025/) about lack of clarity on the NSF GRFP program in 2025. In this petition, we focus more narrowly on and request reversal of the changes in eligilibity that have suddenly disenfranchised and passed over thousands of graduate students.

We in the scientific community have been blindsided by the changes to eligibility for this year’s NSF’s Graduate Research Fellowship Program competition, announced in today’s solicitation, NSF 25-547. For the past months, the U.S.’s most high-potential early-career STEM students have been preparing their applications in anticipation of competing for a GRFP award within their limited window of eligibility. At the same time, they have been anxiously awaiting guidance from a GRFP solicitation that was extraordinarily late. With the new solicitation, GRFP is breaking its promise to future leaders of the U.S. STEM workforce. Here are the impacts of the changes to eligibility:

- Many second-year graduate students did not apply last year because they trusted GRFP’s guidance that they would be able to apply once during their first or second year — a rule that has been in place for the last decade. The change will disproportionately impact those who were undergraduates at small colleges and under-resourced institutions that could not provide them with significant research experience, especially in NSF’s “priority fields”; this is why they waited until they were farther along in their training.
- First-year graduate students who were missing a letter of reference last year were told in last year’s NSF 24-591: “Applications withdrawn by November 15 of the application year do not count toward the one-time graduate application limit.” Those who withdrew their applications did so with the expectation of  preserving their eligibility for this year. 
- Many first-year graduate students had planned to delay applying to next year; now they will be ineligible then. For such students, putting together competitive applications and recruiting letter writers for this year’s competition will be a sprint, if not infeasible.
- The solicitation also states: “In FY2026, Clinical Psychology graduate degree programs are not eligible for NSF GRFP.” Applicants enrolled in such programs have long been eligible if they are doing basic research. GRFP’s longstanding policy has been that a fellow’s field of study does not need to match the name of their program. Changing this policy for only one group of STEM students is grossly unfair. Although fewer students are impacted by this change than the previous three, most of those impacted are women.

When changes to eligibility were last made in 2016, allowing students only one chance (rather than two) to apply after enrolling in graduate school, the change was implemented carefully; a Dear Colleague Letter signed by Assistant EHR Director Joan Ferrini-Mundy (DCL 16-050) was issued with over 7 months’ notice to the community. This allowed students to plan the timing of their applications carefully so that no one was disadvantaged. This year’s sudden shift in policy risks losing a two-year cohort of scientific talent and discourages the very students NSF purports to recruit into STEM. It runs counter to the spirit of the NSF Act of 1950 which specifically established fellowships for broad topics in science training, as well as the 2010 America Competes Act which directs NSF to prepare students for preparation in diverse careers.

We urge NSF to reverse this needlessly abrupt change in eligibility for the current competition (so that graduate students who have not yet applied will be grandfathered in this year), and to implement any needed future changes with appropriate notice, and after soliciting input from the STEM community.
